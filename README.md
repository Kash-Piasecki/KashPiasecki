### ≈Åukasz Piasecki's repository 

Hello everyone. I'm trying to become **junior java developer**. Here you can see my repositories, where I will be trying to upload projects as they're developed. For now there are only 3 basic ones:

* Pure Java command line MiniGame
* Basic website with usage of html/css only
* Spring Boot project (currently learning)
